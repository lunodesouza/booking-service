# üìÖ Booking Service

Booking-Service is a microservice for managing bookings and blocks. It provides RESTful endpoints to create, update, cancel, rebook, and delete bookings, as well as to create, update, and delete blocks, ensuring that no overlapping reservations occur.

## Features

- **Booking Management:** Create, update, cancel, rebook, and delete bookings.
- **Block Management:** Define blocks to prevent overlapping reservations.
- **RESTful API:** Follows REST architectural style.
- **In-memory Database:** Uses H2 database for development and testing.

## Architecture

The project follows a typical Spring Boot microservices structure with separation into controllers, services, repositories, and domain models.
