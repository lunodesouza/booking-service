# üìÖ Booking Service

Booking-Service is a microservice for managing bookings and blocks. It provides RESTful endpoints to create, update, cancel, rebook, and delete bookings, as well as to create, update, and delete blocks, ensuring that no overlapping reservations occur.

## Features

- **Booking Management:** Create, update, cancel, rebook, and delete bookings.
- **Block Management:** Define blocks to prevent overlapping reservations.
- **RESTful API:** Follows REST architectural style.
- **In-memory Database:** Uses H2 database for development and testing.

## Architecture

The project follows a typical Spring Boot microservices structure with separation into controllers, services, repositories, and domain models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven (or use the Maven Wrapper included in the project)
- Docker

### Building the Project

You can build the project using Maven with the Maven Wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

- Replace `{id}` with the actual resource ID (e.g., `/bookings/1`).
- Dates must be in **ISO format** (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

### üöÄ What's Next?

Future improvements for the booking-service:
### 1. Centralized Database for Horizontal Scaling

Replace the in-memory H2 database with a cloud-native database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) to:
- Enable microservices architecture scalability 
- Support distributed transactions 
- Implement connection pooling for performance 
- Facilitate database replication and backups

### 2. Property Management API

Implement a CRUD for Properties to:
- Allow creation/management of properties (name, location, amenities)

### 3. Authentication & Role-Based Access

Add OAuth2/JWT-based authentication with granular permissions:
- Role	
- Permissions 
- Guest	Create/view own bookings 
- Property Owner	
- Manage blocks for owned properties 
- Manager Full Permissions for bookings/blocks/properties

### 4. L2 Caching

Implement second-level caching to:
- Reduce database load for frequent read operations 
- Cache entities like active bookings and blocks 
- Configure time-to-live (TTL) policies:
- Monitor cache hit/miss ratios for optimization

These enhancements will transform the service into a production-ready, scalable solution while maintaining performance and security.
